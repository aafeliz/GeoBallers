Hey team. If you're working on the frontend, all your code should be placed in the /app/public folder. Anything in that folder will be served relative to that root.

`server.js` is the main entry point. To run this server, the command is `node server`. If you need bower/browserify/etc. dependencies, make the file in the root (`/geohack-framework`).
